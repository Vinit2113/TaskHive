It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks, organize them by status or priority, and track progress over time. Built with a modular backend using NestJS and a database for persistent storage, TaskTracker is structured for easy scalability, making it a strong foundation for more advanced features like user authentication, team collaboration, and notifications in future phases.",
