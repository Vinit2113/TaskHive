Project Name: TaskTracker

Description:
TaskTracker is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help individuals and teams manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks, organize them by status or priority, and track progress over time. Built with a modular backend using NestJS and a database for persistent storage, TaskTracker is structured for easy scalability, making it a strong foundation for more advanced features like user authentication, team collaboration, and notifications in future phases.

Key Features (Phase One):

- Add, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks by status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
- Simple, structured backend architecture with NestJS
- Ready for integration with frontend or API clients

Future Scope:

- User authentication and role management
- Team collaboration and shared task boards
- Notifications and reminders
- Analytics and reporting
